## INTERESTS
I have always been an art enthusiast and love experimenting with mediums because of the different ways they can be used to communicate stories. I carry this interest into challenging myself to visualise data in creative ways using different tools. I also dedicate time to learning about social issues through workshops involving critical-thinking and empathetic discussion about global issues. I continuously seek new volunteering opportunities to develop my professional skills so I can advocate for human rights justice in confidence. Driven by the Filipino value of 'kapwa' or our shared humanity, I enjoy planning and organising potlucks and game-centred events to connect friends with strangers and uplift community wellbeing. Most recenly, I founded a miniature model-building club for Gunpla (space fighting robots based off a 
Japanese franchise, Gundam) growing over 70+ members in 3 months. This complex hobby requires 
patience and precision but is incredibly rewarding and we welcome new members on our discord [here](https://discord.com/invite/uxk7AweTF3)!
